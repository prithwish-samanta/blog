## Introduction

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a global service that allows you to manage access to AWS services and
resources securely. You should not use the root account for regular tasks; instead, create individual users and grant
them specific permissions.

## Core Components of IAM

- **Users:** These are the individuals within your organization. A best practice is to have one AWS user for each
  physical user.
- **Groups:** A collection of IAM users. You can assign permissions to a group, and all users in that group will inherit
  those permissions. Groups can only contain users, not other groups. A user can belong to multiple groups.
- **Policies:** These are JSON documents that define permissions. You can attach policies to users or groups to control
  what actions they can perform on which resources. Always apply the principle of least privilege, meaning you should
  only grant the permissions that are absolutely necessary for a user to perform their tasks.
- **Roles:** IAM Roles provide a way to grant temporary permissions to AWS services or entities. For example, you can
  assign a role to an EC2 instance to allow it to access S3 buckets without needing to store long-term credentials on
  the instance.

## IAM Policies

An IAM policy is a JSON document with the following structure:

- **Version**: The policy language version, which is typically "2012-10-17"
- **Statement:** One or more individual statements that define the permissions. Each statement includes:
    - **Effect:** Specifies whether the permission is "Allow" or "Deny".
    - **Action:** The list of actions that are allowed or denied (e.g., "s3:GetObject").
    - **Resource:** The AWS resources that the action applies to, identified by their ARN (Amazon Resource Name).
    - **Principal:** The user, account, or service that is allowed or denied access (used in resource-based policies).
    - **Sid:** A statement identifier (optional).
    - **Condition:** Conditions for when the policy is in effect (optional).

## Security Best Practices

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enhance security by requiring a second form of authentication in addition to a
  password. This protects your account even if a password is stolen. AWS supports various MFA devices, including:
    - Virtual MFA devices like Google Authenticator or Authy.
    - Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security keys like YubiKey.
    - Hardware Key Fob MFA devices.

- **Strong Password Policy:** Enforce strong password requirements for your users. You can set policies for:
    - Minimum password length.
    - Required character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, non-alphanumeric).
    - Password expiration and preventing password reuse.

## Programmatic Access to AWS

Users can interact with AWS in three ways:

- **AWS Management Console:** Web-based interface protected by a password and optional MFA.
- **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI):** A tool to manage AWS services from your terminal using commands. It is protected
  by access keys.
- **AWS Software Development Kit (SDK):** Allows you to access and manage AWS services programmatically from your
  applications using language-specific APIs. It is also protected by access keys.

**Access Keys** are used for CLI and SDK access. They consist of an **Access Key ID** (like a username) and a **Secret
Access
Key** (like a password). These keys are secret and should never be shared. It's a best practice to rotate them
frequently

## Auditing and Monitoring IAM

AWS provides tools to help you audit and manage your IAM configurations:

- **IAM Credentials Report:** An account-level report that lists all users in your account and the status of their
  credentials, including passwords, access keys, and MFA devices.
- I**AM Access Advisor:** A user-level tool that shows the service permissions a user has and when they last accessed
  those services. This helps you identify and remove unused permissions, enforcing the principle of least privilege.

## Summary of IAM Best Practices

- Avoid using the root user for daily tasks.
- Create individual IAM users for each person.
- Use groups to manage permissions for users.
- Enforce a strong password policy and the use of MFA.
- Use roles for giving permissions to AWS services.
- Use access keys for programmatic access via the CLI and SDK, and never share them.
- Regularly audit permissions using the IAM Credentials Report and Access Advisor.
