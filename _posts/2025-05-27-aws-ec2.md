## Introduction

- **EC2** = Elastic Compute Cloud
- Resizable compute capacity (virtual machines) in the cloud.
- **Nitro System:** The underlying platform for many modern EC2 instances, providing enhanced performance, security, and
  faster innovation. Key components include Nitro Cards, Nitro Security Chip, and Nitro Hypervisor.
- **Instance Types:** Optimized for different workloads:
    - **General Purpose (e.g., M-family, T-family):** Balanced CPU, memory, networking. Good for web servers,
      small/medium databases, dev/test environments.
        - **T-instances (e.g., T3, T4g):** Burstable performance. They accrue CPU credits when idle and use them when
          busy. Understand CPU Credits and Baseline Performance. Unlimited mode can sustain high CPU performance for a
          cost.
    - **Compute Optimized (e.g., C-family):** High-performance processors. Good for batch processing, media transcoding,
      high-performance web servers, scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers.
    - **Memory Optimized (e.g., R-family, X-family, z1d):** Large memory-to-CPU ratio. Ideal for in-memory databases (
      e.g., SAP HANA), real-time big data analytics, large caches.
    - **Storage Optimized (e.g., I-family, D-family, H-family):** High disk throughput and IOPS.
        - **I-family (e.g., I3, I3en, I4i):** NVMe SSD-based instance store for very high random I/O, low latency (NoSQL
          DBs like Cassandra, Aerospike).
        - **D-family (e.g., D2, D3):** Dense HDD storage for data warehousing, distributed file systems (e.g., Hadoop).
        - **H-family (e.g., H1):** For HDD-based workloads requiring a balance of compute and storage.
    - **Accelerated Computing (e.g., P-family, G-family, F-family, Inf-family, Trn-family):** GPUs, FPGAs, or AWS custom
      ML chips.
        - **P-family (e.g., P3, P4d):** General-purpose GPU compute (ML, HPC).
        - **G-family (e.g., G4dn, G5):** Graphics-intensive applications, ML inference, video rendering.
        - **Inf-family (Inferentia), Trn-family (Trainium):** AWS custom chips for cost-effective ML inference and
          training.
    - **Instance Sizes: (nano, micro, small, medium, large, xlarge, metal, etc.):** Scales CPU, memory, storage, and
      network bandwidth. metal instances provide direct access to the host server's hardware.

## Pricing Models & Purchasing Options

- **On-Demand:** Pay per second (Linux/Windows) or per hour with no long-term commitment. Ideal for short-term, spiky,
  or
  unpredictable workloads where you can't interrupt the application.
- **Reserved Instances (RIs):** Significant discount (up to 72%) compared to On-Demand for a 1 or 3-year commitment.
    - **Standard RIs:** Best discount, but less flexible (instance family, OS, tenancy, region fixed).
    - **Convertible RIs:** Lower discount than Standard, but allows changing instance family, OS, tenancy, scope (during
      the
      term).
    - **Scheduled RIs:** Reserve instances for specific recurring time windows (e.g., daily, weekly).
    - **Scope:**
        - **Regional RIs:** Apply discount to any AZ within the region, instance size flexibility within the family. No
          capacity reservation.
        - **Zonal RIs:** Apply discount in a specific AZ, provide a capacity reservation in that AZ.
    - **Spot Instances:** Request unused EC2 capacity for up to 90% discount off On-Demand prices.
        - **Use Cases:** Fault-tolerant, flexible workloads (batch jobs, big data analytics, CI/CD, stateless web
          servers).
        - **Interruption:** Can be terminated by AWS with a 2-minute warning if capacity is needed or your bid price is
          exceeded.
        - **Spot Blocks:** Request Spot Instances for a defined duration (1-6 hours) with less likelihood of
          interruption.
        - **Best Practices:** Use with Auto Scaling, diversify instance types and AZs.
    - **Dedicated Hosts:** Physical server dedicated to your use. Helps meet compliance requirements, use existing
      server-bound software licenses (BYOL). You control instance placement. Most expensive.
    - **Dedicated Instances:** Instances run on hardware dedicated to a single customer's account, but you don't control
      instance placement on the host like with Dedicated Hosts.
    - **Savings Plans:** Commit to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1 or 3-year term. More
      flexible than RIs.
        - **EC2 Instance Savings Plans:** Most flexibility for EC2. Apply to any instance family and OS within a chosen
          AWS Region.
        - **Compute Savings Plans:** Broadest flexibility. Apply to EC2 instances (any family, region, OS, tenancy), AWS
          Fargate, and AWS Lambda.
    - **Capacity Reservations (On-Demand):** Reserve compute capacity for your EC2 instances in a specific AZ for any
      duration. No billing discount, but ensures capacity is available when you launch On-Demand instances.

## AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

- Pre-configured templates for EC2 instances (OS, applications, configurations). AMIs are **Regional**.
- **Sources:**
    - **AWS Provided (Quick Start):** Common OSs.
    - **AWS Marketplace:** Commercial and free software from vendors.
    - **Community AMIs:** Shared by other AWS users (use with caution).
    - **My AMIs (Custom):** Created from your own instances or imported.
- **Storage for the Root Device:**
    - **EBS-backed:** Root volume is an EBS volume. **Persistent** (data remains if instance is stopped). Default. Can
      be
      stopped.
    - **Instance Store-backed (Ephemeral):** Root volume is on instance store. **Non-persistent** (data lost if instance
      is
      stopped, hibernated, or terminated, or if the underlying host fails). Cannot be stopped (only terminate or
      reboot). Faster boot times often.
- **Copying AMIs:** Copy AMIs across regions or share with other AWS accounts for DR, latency optimization, or
  standardized
  deployments.
- **EC2 Image Builder:** Service to automate the creation, management, and deployment of customized, secure, and
  up-to-date "golden" server images.

## Storage Options

- **Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage):**
    - Physically attached to the host computer (block-level storage).
    - Provides very high I/O performance (especially NVMe SSDs).
    - **Data is temporary:** Lost if the instance is stopped (for EBS-backed root, instance store data is lost),
      hibernated, terminated, or if the underlying host hardware fails.
    - Good for temporary data, caches, buffers, or data replicated across a fleet.
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store):**
    - Network-attached, persistent block storage volumes. Data persists independently of instance life.
    - **AZ-bound:** Volumes are created in a specific Availability Zone. To attach to an instance in another AZ, create
      a
      snapshot and then a volume from the snapshot in the target AZ.
    - **Volume Types:**
        - **General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3):**
            - `gp2`: Balances price and performance. IOPS scale with volume size (3 IOPS/GiB, burst up to 3,000 IOPS).
            - `gp3`: **Latest generation.** Allows provisioning IOPS (3,000 IOPS baseline) and throughput (125 MiB/s
              baseline) **independently of storage size**. Often more cost-effective and performant than gp2.
        - **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2/io2 Block Express):**
            - `io1/io2`: For critical, I/O-intensive workloads (large databases) requiring sustained high IOPS. You
              specify IOPS rate. io2 offers higher durability and IOPS/GiB ratio than io1.
            - `io2 Block Express`: Highest performance EBS volume, designed for sub-millisecond latency. Largest
              capacity.
        - **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1):** Low-cost HDD for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads (big
          data, data warehouses, log processing). Cannot be a boot volume.
        - **Cold HDD (sc1):** Lowest cost HDD for less frequently accessed data (archival, data that requires infrequent
          access). Cannot be a boot volume.
    - **Features:**
        - **Encryption:** At-rest encryption using AWS KMS (Key Management Service). Minimal performance impact.
          Snapshots of encrypted volumes are also encrypted. Data in transit between instance and encrypted volume is
          encrypted if the instance supports it (Nitro-based instances).
        - **Snapshots:** Point-in-time backups of EBS volumes, stored redundantly in **Amazon S3**. Snapshots are *
          *incremental** (only changed blocks are saved). Can be used to create new volumes, resize volumes, or copy
          across regions/AZs.
            - **Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR):** Enables you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully initialized
              at creation, eliminating latency for first access.
        - **Resizing:** Modify volume size and sometimes type/IOPS without downtime (for most modern Linux/Windows OS
          and instance types).
        - **Multi-Attach (io1/io2 only):** Attach a single Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to multiple Nitro-based instances
          in the same AZ. Requires a clustered file system.

## Networking & Security

- **Security Groups (SGs):**
    - **Stateful firewall** at the **instance level** (operates at the ENI).
    - **Allow rules only.** No deny rules.
    - Default: Deny all inbound traffic. Allow all outbound traffic.
    - Can reference other SGs as source/destination.
    - Changes apply immediately.
- **NACLs (Network ACLs):**
    - **Stateless firewall** at the **subnet level.**
    - **Explicit allow and deny rules.** Rules are evaluated in order by number.
    - Default NACL: Allows all inbound and outbound traffic. Custom NACLs: Deny all inbound and outbound traffic by
      default.
- **Key Pairs:** Used for SSH access (Linux) or to get the password for RDP access (Windows).
    - Public key is stored by AWS; private key is stored by you.
    - **If you lose your private key, you cannot connect to the instance** (unless you have another way in, e.g., SSM
      Agent,
      or for EBS-backed instances, detach root volume, attach to another instance, modify, reattach). Store private keys
      securely.
- **Elastic IPs (EIPs):** Static public IPv4 addresses you can allocate to your account and associate with an instance
  or network interface.
    - Masks instance failure by remapping to another instance.
    - Limited to 5 per account by default (can be increased).
    - **Charged if not associated with a running instance OR if associated with a stopped instance OR if associated with
      an ENI not attached to an instance.**
- **ENI (Elastic Network Interface):** Virtual network card in your VPC.
    - Can have primary private IPv4, one or more secondary private IPv4s, one Elastic IP per private IPv4, one Public
      IPv4, MAC address, SGs.
    - Can be created independently and attached/detached from instances (hot, warm, or cold attach).
    - Use cases: Dual-homing, management network, licensing tied to MAC addresses.
- **Public IP vs. Elastic IP:**
    - **Public IP:** Dynamically assigned to an instance at launch (if in a public subnet with auto-assign enabled),
      cannot be moved to another instance. Lost on stop/terminate.
    - **Elastic IP:** Static, remains with your account until released. Can be moved between instances.
- **Instance Connect Endpoint (EIC Endpoint):** Provides SSH/RDP connectivity to EC2 instances (including those in
  private subnets) without needing public IPs, bastion hosts, or VPN. Uses IAM for access control.
- **DNS:** Instances get private DNS hostnames. Can get public DNS hostnames if they have a public IP. Resolution within
  VPC.
- **Enhanced Networking:**
    - Uses **ENA (Elastic Network Adapter)** or Intel 82599 VF interface for higher bandwidth, higher PPS (Packets Per
      Second), and lower inter-instance latency. Standard on most modern instances.

## Advanced Features

- **Placement Groups:** Influence the placement of interdependent instances. **Cannot span AZs**.
    - **Cluster:** Packs instances close together within a single AZ. For low-latency, high-throughput network
      communication (HPC, tightly-coupled applications). Risk: single hardware failure can impact all instances.
    - **Spread:** Spreads instances across distinct underlying hardware within an AZ (max 7 instances per AZ per group)
      or across AZs (for groups that span AZs, but each instance is in a different AZ on different hardware). Reduces
      correlated failures, for critical applications.
    - **Partition:** Divides instances into logical partitions within an AZ, each partition on a separate rack with its
      own network and power. For large distributed and replicated workloads (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka). Minimizes impact
      of hardware failures.
- **Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA):** Network interface for HPC and ML applications needing high levels of inter-node
  communication. Bypasses OS kernel for lower, more consistent latency and higher throughput. Uses libfabric.
- **Hibernation:**
    - Saves the in-memory (RAM) state of the instance to the EBS root volume upon stop. Instance boots much faster as
      RAM is restored.
    - **Requirements:** EBS-backed root volume (encrypted), instance RAM ≤ 150 GB, supported instance families & OS.
    - You are charged for EBS storage used for RAM data. Instance store data is NOT preserved.
- **Instance Metadata & User Data:**
    - **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS):** Access instance information (instance ID, IP address, IAM role credentials)
      via a link-local address: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`.
    - **IMDSv2 (Version 2):** More secure, session-oriented requests. **Recommended to enforce IMDSv2.**
    - **User Data:** Scripts executed at instance launch (bootstrapping). Used to install software, apply patches,
      configure the instance. Max 16KB.
- **EC2 Instance Connect:** Simple and secure way to connect to Linux instances using SSH. Uses IAM permissions.

## Auto Scaling & Load Balancing

- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG):**
    - Maintain a desired number of instances. Automatically replaces unhealthy/terminated instances. Scales in/out based
      on demand.
    - **Components:** Launch Template/Configuration, Min/Max/Desired capacity.
    - **Launch Templates (Recommended) vs. Launch Configurations (Legacy):**
        - **Launch Templates:** Versioning, support multiple instance types (Spot & On-Demand mix), T2/T3 Unlimited,
          Dedicated Hosts, more parameter options. Preferred.
        - **Launch Configurations:** Older, no versioning, less flexible.
    - **Scaling Policies:**
        - **Target Tracking:** Maintain a metric at a target value (e.g., average CPU utilization at 40%). Preferred and
          simplest.
        - **Step Scaling:** Respond to alarms with scaling adjustments that vary based on the size of the alarm breach.
        - **Simple Scaling:** Respond to alarms with a single scaling adjustment. (Wait for cooldown before next
          action).
        - **Scheduled Scaling:** Scale based on a predictable schedule.
        - **Predictive Scaling:** Uses ML to predict future traffic and provision capacity in advance.
    - **Health Checks:**
        - **EC2 Status Checks:** Default. Checks underlying instance health.
        - **ELB Health Checks:** ASG can use ELB health checks if instances are behind a load balancer. More
          application-aware.
    - **Cooldown Period:** Prevents ASG from launching or terminating additional instances before previous scaling
      activity takes effect (default 300 seconds).
    - **Termination Policies:** Control which instances ASG terminates first during scale-in (e.g., oldest instance,
      newest instance, closest to next billing hour).
    - **Lifecycle Hooks:** Pause instance launch or termination to perform custom actions (e.g., install software,
      download logs).
- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):** Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
    - **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS).
        - Advanced routing: Path-based, host-based, query string, HTTP header routing.
        - Supports microservices, containers (ECS, EKS).
        - Target Groups can include instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions.
        - Supports WebSockets, HTTP/2.
        - Access Logs, SSL/TLS termination, SNI (multiple SSL certs).
    - **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** Layer 4 (TCP/UDP/TLS).
        - Ultra-high performance, low latency.
        - Static IP address per AZ (or one EIP per AZ).
        - Preserves source IP address of the client.
        - Ideal for TCP traffic where extreme performance is required.
    - **Gateway Load Balancer (GLB):** Layer 3 (IP packets).
        - Deploy, scale, and manage third-party virtual network appliances (firewalls, IDS/IPS).
        - Transparently inserts appliances into the network path.
    - **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** Legacy. Layer 4/7. Avoid for new applications; use ALB or NLB instead.
    - **Cross-Zone Load Balancing:**
        - ALB: Enabled by default. Distributes traffic evenly across all registered instances in all enabled AZs.
        - NLB: Disabled by default. When enabled, distributes traffic across instances in all enabled AZs. Charged for
          inter-AZ data transfer.
        - CLB: Disabled by default.
    - **Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity):** Binds a user's session to a specific target instance (ALB, CLB). NLB
      achieves this via target group settings.
    - **SSL/TLS Termination:** Offload SSL processing from instances to the LB.
    - **Server Name Indication (SNI):** Allows hosting multiple TLS-secured websites with different certificates on a
      single listener (ALB, NLB).

## Monitoring & Maintenance

- **CloudWatch:**
    - **Metrics:** Collects and tracks metrics. EC2 default metrics: CPU Utilization, Network In/Out, Disk Read/Write
      Ops,
      Status Checks.
        - **CPU Credit Usage/Balance:** Key for T-family instances.
    - **Detailed Monitoring:** 1-minute granularity for EC2 metrics (default is 5-minute). Additional cost. Crucial for
      faster reaction with ASG.
    - **Alarms:** Trigger notifications or actions (e.g., ASG scaling, SNS notification) based on metric thresholds.
    - **Logs:** CloudWatch Logs for collecting, monitoring, and storing log files from EC2 (via CloudWatch Agent),
      CloudTrail, and other sources.
    - **Dashboards:** Create custom views of metrics.
- **EC2 Status Checks:**
    - **System Status Checks:** Monitor the AWS hardware and software underlying your instance. AWS responsibility. If
      failed, AWS might schedule maintenance or you might need to stop/start the instance (moves to new host).
    - **Instance Status Checks:** Monitor the software and network configuration of your individual instance. Your
      responsibility (OS issues, misconfigurations). If failed, troubleshoot the OS or reboot.
- **AWS Systems Manager (SSM):**
    - Operational hub for AWS. Helps manage EC2 instances and on-premises systems at scale.
    - **Key Capabilities:**
        - **Run Command:** Execute commands remotely without SSH/RDP.
        - **Patch Manager:** Automate OS patching.
        - **Session Manager:** Secure, browser-based shell or CLI access to instances without opening inbound SSH/RDP
          ports, needing bastion hosts, or managing SSH keys. Uses IAM for access control. Highly recommended for
          security.
        - **Parameter Store & Secrets Manager:** Securely store configuration data and secrets.
        - **Inventory, State Manager, Maintenance Windows.**

## High Availability (HA) & Disaster Recovery (DR)

- **Multi-AZ Deployments:** Core principle for HA.
    - Launch instances across multiple AZs using an ASG.
    - Use ELB to distribute traffic to instances in multiple AZs.
- **EBS Snapshots:** Essential for DR.
    - Regularly back up EBS volumes.
    - Copy snapshots to other regions for cross-region DR.
- **AMI Sharing/Copying:** Replicate AMIs to other regions/accounts for DR.
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective) & RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Understand how EC2 and related services (EBS
  snapshots, AMIs, ASG) contribute to achieving your RPO/RTO targets.
- **DR Strategies (EC2 Role):**
    - **Backup and Restore:** Lowest cost, highest RTO/RPO. Relies on AMIs/snapshots.
    - **Pilot Light:** Minimal version of environment always running in DR region.
    - **Warm Standby:** Scaled-down version of full environment in DR region.
    - **Multi-Site Active-Active:** Full environment in multiple regions, serving traffic. (More complex than just EC2).

## Best Practices

- **Cost Optimization:**
    - Use **RIs/Savings Plans** for steady-state, predictable workloads.
    - Leverage **Spot Instances** for fault-tolerant, flexible, and non-critical jobs.
    - **Right-size instances:** Monitor with CloudWatch and adjust instance types/sizes.
    - Shut down/terminate unused instances.
    - Use **gp3** EBS volumes for better price/performance over gp2.
    - Use **Auto Scaling** to match capacity with demand.
- **Security**
    - **IAM Roles for EC2 Instances:** Grant permissions to AWS services without embedding access keys on instances. Never
      store access keys on an EC2 instance.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** For IAM roles and Security Group rules.
    - **Security Groups & NACLs:** Implement defense in depth.
    - **Encrypt EBS volumes and snapshots** (at-rest encryption).
    - Use HTTPS for data in transit (ELB termination, application-level).
    - Keep OS and applications patched (use Systems Manager Patch Manager).
    - Use **IMDSv2.**
    - Use **Session Manager** or **Instance Connect Endpoint** instead of opening SSH/RDP ports to the internet.
- **Performance**
    - Choose the **right instance type and size** for your workload.
    - Use **EBS-Optimized Instances** for dedicated EBS bandwidth (standard on most modern instances).
    - Select appropriate **EBS volume types** (e.g., io2 for high IOPS DBs, gp3 for general use).
    - Use **Enhanced Networking (ENA).**
    - Consider **Placement Groups** for latency-sensitive applications.
- **Resilience & Fault Tolerance:**
    - Use **Auto Scaling Groups** with **ELB** across multiple AZs.
    - Design for failure; expect instances to fail.
    - Regularly back up data (EBS snapshots, AMIs).
    - Implement robust health checks.
- **Shared Responsibility Model for EC2:**
    - **AWS manages:** Security of the cloud (hardware, global infrastructure, hypervisor).
    - **You manage:** Security in the cloud (OS, applications, data, IAM, SGs, NACLs, patching).

## Key Scenarios & Use Cases
- **Web Application Hosting:** ALB + ASG with instances in public/private subnets across multiple AZs. Databases (RDS) in private subnets.
- **Batch Processing/Big Data:** Spot Instances/Spot Fleets managed by ASG or services like EMR/Batch. Store persistent data in S3 or EBS.
- **High-Performance Computing (HPC):** Cluster Placement Groups, EFAs, Compute Optimized instances.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Cross-region AMI/snapshot copies, ASGs configured for DR region, Route 53 for DNS failover.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** AWS Direct Connect or VPN. EC2 instances can integrate with on-premises resources. AWS Outposts for running EC2 on-premises.
- **Stateless Applications:** Ideal for Auto Scaling and Spot Instances. Store state externally (e.g., S3, DynamoDB, ElastiCache).
- **Stateful Applications:** Require careful handling of state. EBS for persistent storage, potentially RIs for stable workloads.

## Important Exam Tips & Keywords
- **Spot Fleets vs. Spot Instances:** A Spot Fleet is a collection of Spot Instances and optionally On-Demand Instances, aiming to meet a target capacity with your price constraints.
- **Termination Protection:** Disabled by default. Enable to prevent accidental termination via AWS Console, CLI, or API. ASG can still terminate instances.
- **Stop Protection:** Prevent accidental stopping of an instance via Console, CLI, or API.
- **EBS-backed vs. Instance Store-backed:** Crucial distinction for persistence, stop/start capability, and boot times. EBS for persistent data.
- **Vertical Scaling:** Changing instance type/size (usually requires stop -> modify -> start).
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Adding/removing instances (ASG).
- **Encryption:**
  - **EBS Encryption:** At-rest encryption using KMS.
  - **HTTPS/TLS:** In-transit encryption.
- **Launch Templates** are preferred over Launch Configurations. 
- **IMDSv2** for enhanced metadata security. 
- **SSM Session Manager** for secure instance access. 
- Understand **instance lifecycle** states: pending, running, stopping, stopped, shutting-down, terminated. 
- **Troubleshooting:** Common issues involve SGs, NACLs, route tables, key pairs, instance status checks, IAM permissions. 
- **EC2 Limits:** Default limits exist (e.g., vCPUs per region, EIPs). Know how to request increases.
- **Dedicated Hosts vs. Dedicated Instances:** Understand the control and licensing implications.
- **CPU Credits (T-instances):** Know how they work and what "burstable" means.
