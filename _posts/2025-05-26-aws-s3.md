## Introduction

- **S3** = Simple Storage Service
- **Object Storage:** Stores data as objects (files + metadata) in buckets.
- **Scalability:** Virtually unlimited storage.
- **Durability:** 99.999999999% (11 9s) for all storage classes (except S3 One Zone-IA).
- **S3 One Zone-IA Durability:** Designed for 99.999999999% durability within a single Availability Zone, but data will
  be
  lost in the event of AZ destruction.
- **Availability:** Varies by storage class (e.g., S3 Standard: 99.99%, S3 Standard-IA: 99.9%, S3 One Zone-IA: 99.5%,
  Glacier: 99.99% after restore).
- **Global Namespace:** Bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts and regions.
- **Regions:** Buckets are created in a specific AWS region (choose for latency, cost, compliance, or to be near other
  AWS resources like EC2).

## S3 Storage Classes

| Class                             | Use Case                                                                          | Min. Duration | Retrieval Time | Cost                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S3 Standard**                   | Frequently accessed, general-purpose data                                         | None          | Milliseconds   | Highest storage cost; low per-request cost                                              |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**        | Data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access                              | None          | Milliseconds   | Small monthly monitoring & automation fee per object; tiers match Standard & IA pricing |
| **S3 Standard-IA**                | Long-lived, infrequently accessed, needed quickly                                 | 30 days       | Milliseconds   | Lower storage cost than Standard; per GB retrieval fee                                  |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**                | Recreatable, infrequently accessed, non-critical data                             | 30 days       | Milliseconds   | Lower storage cost than S3 Standard-IA; per GB retrieval fee                            |
| **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**  | Archive data needing millisecond access                                           | 90 days       | Milliseconds   | Very low storage; higher retrieval cost than S3 Standard-IA                             |
| **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** | Archives (retrieval options: Expedited 1-5 min, Standard 3-5 hrs, Bulk 5-12 hrs)	 | 90 days       | Minutesâ€“Hours  | Very low storage cost; retrieval cost varies by speed                                   |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**       | Long-term archival, data accessed rarely (1-2 times/yr)	                          | 180 days      | Hours          | Lowest storage cost; retrieval cost varies by speed                                     |

### Key Elaboration for Intelligent-Tiering:

- Automatically moves data to the most cost-effective access tier based on access patterns.
- Includes **Archive Access Tiers (optional):** Glacier Instant Retrieval, Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and Glacier Deep
  Archive. Objects not accessed for 30 consecutive days are moved to the Frequent Access tier, then after 90 days of no
  access to the Infrequent Access tier. You can configure movement to one or both archive tiers (e.g., after 90, 180
  days).
- No retrieval fees when data moves between the Frequent and Infrequent Access tiers within Intelligent-Tiering.

## Key Features

### Versioning

- Preserves all versions of an object (including deletions via "delete markers").
- Once enabled on a bucket, it **cannot be disabled**, only suspended.
- Essential for protecting against accidental overwrites and deletions.
- Required for Cross-Region Replication (CRR) and Same-Region Replication (SRR).
- MFA Delete: Optional extra security layer to change bucket versioning state or permanently delete object versions.

### Lifecycle Management

- Automates transitioning objects between storage classes or expiring them.
- Rules: Based on object age (creation date or last modified date), prefix, tags, or number of noncurrent versions.
- Can be used to transition objects to colder storage (e.g., S3 Standard -> Standard-IA -> Glacier) or delete old
  objects/versions.
- **Important Note:** There are minimum storage duration charges for IA/Glacier classes; transitioning too early can
  incur
  unexpected costs. Lifecycle rules for transitioning to IA classes also have minimum object size requirements (e.g.,
  128KB for Standard-IA).

### Encryption

- **Encryption in Transit:** Achieved using HTTPS (SSL/TLS).
- **Encryption at Rest:**
    - **SSE-S3:** Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys. AWS manages the keys. Default encryption option if
      no
      other is specified. Uses AES-256.
    - **SSE-KMS:** Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service. AWS manages keys, but you manage them within
      KMS (control rotation, usage policies). Provides an audit trail via CloudTrail for key usage. Offers an additional
      layer of security and control.
    - **SSE-C:** Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys. You manage the encryption keys. S3 performs
      encryption/decryption. AWS does not store your keys. HTTPS is mandatory.
    - **Client-Side Encryption:** Encrypt data before uploading it to S3. You manage the encryption process and keys.
- **Enforcing Encryption:** Use bucket policies to deny uploads if they don't include encryption headers.

### Replication

- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR):**
    - Asynchronous replication of new objects to a bucket in a different region.
    - Versioning must be enabled on both source and destination buckets.
    - Use cases: Disaster recovery, lower latency access for users in different geographic locations, compliance.
    - Can replicate to different AWS accounts.
- **Same-Region Replication (SRR):**
    - Asynchronous replication of **new** objects to another bucket in the **same** region.
    - Versioning must be enabled.
    - Use cases: Log aggregation, production and test account synchronization, data sovereignty requirements (keeping
      data within a specific region with multiple copies).
    - Can replicate to different AWS accounts.
- **S3 Batch Replication:** Replicate existing objects (that were put before replication was enabled).
- **Replication Time Control (RTC):** Provides an SLA for replicating 99.99% of objects within 15 minutes (additional
  cost).

### Access Control

- **IAM Policies:** User/group/role-based permissions. Applied to IAM identities.
- **Bucket Policies:** Resource-based policies (JSON format) attached to buckets. Control access to the bucket and its
  objects. Good for cross-account access or granting public access with conditions.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Legacy mechanism. Can control access at both bucket and individual object levels.
  Generally, IAM and bucket policies are preferred. **Disable ACLs for new buckets (S3 Object Ownership setting)** and
  use
  policies unless there's a specific cross-account object-level permission need that policies can't cover easily.
- **S3 Object Ownership:**
    - **Bucket owner preferred (default for new buckets):** Bucket owner owns all objects, simplifying access management
      using bucket policies. ACLs are disabled.
    - **Object writer:** Object writer (another account) retains ownership.
- **Block Public Access:** A set of settings at the account or bucket level that can override ACLs and bucket policies
  to prevent public access. **Highly recommended to be enabled.**
- **Access Points:** Create unique hostnames with distinct permissions for specific applications or teams accessing
  shared
  datasets. Simplifies managing access to large shared buckets.
- **Access Analyzer for S3:** Helps identify buckets configured to allow access to external entities.

## Security & Compliance

- **MFA Delete:** Requires Multi-Factor Authentication to change a bucket's versioning state or permanently delete an
  object
  version.
- **Pre-signed URLs:** Grant temporary access (with specific permissions and duration) to private objects. Generated
  using
  AWS SDK/CLI with your credentials.
- **Object Lock:** Provides Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) protection. Prevents objects from being deleted or overwritten
  for a
  fixed amount of time or indefinitely.
    - Retention Period: Specifies a fixed period during which an object version remains locked. Two modes:
        - Governance Mode: Users with specific IAM permissions can override or remove lock settings.
        - Compliance Mode: Lock settings cannot be overridden or removed by any user, including the root account.
    - Legal Hold: Similar to retention period but has no expiry date; remains in effect until explicitly removed.
- **Glacier Vault Lock:** Enforces compliance controls for individual Glacier vaults via a lockable policy (e.g., WORM).
  Once locked, the policy is immutable.
- **Logging:**
    - **Server Access Logs:** Detailed records for requests made to your S3 bucket. Delivered to another target S3
      bucket.
    - **AWS CloudTrail:** Logs API calls made to S3 (e.g., CreateBucket, DeleteObject). Can be configured to log data
      events (object-level operations like GetObject, PutObject).
- **S3 Storage Lens:** Organization-wide visibility into object storage usage, activity trends, and cost-efficiency
  recommendations.

## Performance & Optimization

- **Multipart Upload:**
    - Recommended for files >100MB; required for files >5GB.
    - Allows parallel upload of parts, improving throughput and resilience to network issues.
    - Can pause and resume uploads.
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration:**
    - Uses CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations to accelerate uploads and downloads over long distances.
    - DNS routes traffic to the nearest edge location, then over AWS backbone to S3.
    - Incurs additional cost.
- **S3 Select / Glacier Select:**
    - Retrieve only a subset of data from an object using simple SQL expressions.
    - Works on objects stored in CSV, JSON, or Parquet format.
    - Reduces data transfer and processing, improving performance and lowering costs.
- **Byte-Range Fetches:** Download only a specific portion of an object. Good for partial reads or resuming downloads.
- **Performance Design Patterns:**
    - **Prefixes:** Distribute object keys across multiple prefixes (e.g., `logs/2024/05/26/, images/productA/`) to
      optimize
      performance. S3 can achieve thousands of requests per second per prefix.
    - Avoid sequential naming if high request rates are expected to a single prefix.
- **S3 Batch Operations:** Perform large-scale batch operations on S3 objects (e.g., copy objects, invoke Lambda
  functions,
  change ACLs/tags). S3 manages retries and provides completion reports.

## Event Notifications

- Trigger AWS Lambda functions, Amazon SNS topics, or Amazon SQS queues in response to S3 events (e.g., `s3:
  ObjectCreated:*`, `s3:ObjectRemoved:*`, `s3:ObjectRestore:*`).
- Can be filtered by object prefix or suffix.
- **Use cases:** Image thumbnail generation, data processing, notifications, triggering workflows.

## Static Website Hosting

- Host static websites (HTML, CSS, JS, images) directly from an S3 bucket.
- Bucket name often matches the domain name (e.g., `www.example.com`).
- Requires enabling public access to the bucket content (or use CloudFront with Origin Access Identity/Control).
- Configure an index document (e.g., `index.html`) and an optional error document (e.g., `error.html`).
- **Note:** S3 website endpoints do not support HTTPS directly. For HTTPS, use CloudFront in front of the S3 bucket.

## Cost Considerations

- **Storage:** Cost per GB varies by storage class and region.
- **Requests and Data Retrievals:** Cost for PUT, COPY, POST, LIST, GET, SELECT requests. Retrieval fees apply to IA and
  Glacier classes.
- **Data Transfer:**
    - Data transfer IN to S3 from the internet is free.
    - Data transfer OUT from S3 to the internet is charged per GB (varies by region, tiered pricing).
    - Data transfer between S3 buckets in different regions is charged.
    - Data transfer between S3 and other AWS services in the same region is generally free (e.g., EC2 to S3 in same
      region, if using private IPs/gateway endpoint).
- **Lifecycle Transition Requests:** Costs for moving objects between storage classes.
- **S3 Inventory, Analytics, and Object Tagging:** Incur costs for storing report files and for analytics/tagging
  features.
- **S3 Storage Lens:** Free metrics are available, advanced metrics and recommendations have a cost.
- **Transfer Acceleration:** Additional cost per GB transferred.

## Integration with AWS Services

- **CloudFront:** CDN to cache S3 content at edge locations for lower latency and reduced S3 load. Can be used for HTTPS
  with static websites. Use Origin Access Identity (OAI) or Origin Access Control (OAC) to restrict direct S3 access,
  forcing users through CloudFront.
- **Lambda:** Process S3 events for serverless computing.
- **Athena:** Query data directly in S3 using standard SQL (serverless).
- **Redshift Spectrum:** Query data in S3 from your Redshift data warehouse.
- **EMR:** Process large datasets stored in S3.
- **Storage Gateway:** Hybrid cloud storage solution connecting on-premises environments to S3.
- **AWS Backup:** Centrally manage and automate backups of S3 data along with other AWS services.

## Key Exam Scenarios

- **Disaster Recovery:** Use CRR for cross-region backups. Consider S3 Versioning.
- **Cost Optimization:** Lifecycle policies to transition to cheaper classes (Standard -> IA -> Glacier -> Deep
  Archive). Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering for unknown access patterns. Use S3 Storage Lens and S3 Analytics to identify
  cost-saving opportunities.
- **Security:** Block Public Access, encryption (SSE-S3 by default, SSE-KMS for managed keys with audit trails, SSE-C
  for customer keys), bucket policies, IAM roles, pre-signed URLs, Access Points.
- **Compliance:** Object Lock (Governance vs. Compliance modes), Glacier Vault Lock, versioning, server access logging,
  CloudTrail for API activity.
- **Decoupling Applications:** S3 as a staging area for data to be processed by other services (e.g., uploads trigger
  Lambda).
- **Data Lakes:** S3 as the central storage for a data lake, queried by Athena, Redshift Spectrum, EMR.
- **High-Performance Applications:** Consider prefix design, Transfer Acceleration, multipart upload.

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Access Denied (403 Forbidden):**
    - Check IAM user/role policies (identity-based).
    - Check Bucket Policy (resource-based).
    - Check S3 Block Public Access settings (account and bucket level).
    - Check ACLs (if still in use).
    - If using SSE-KMS, ensure the IAM entity has kms:Decrypt permissions on the key.
    - For cross-account access, ensure both accounts grant necessary permissions.
- **Slow Uploads/Downloads:**
    - Use Multipart Upload for large files.
    - Consider S3 Transfer Acceleration for geographically distant users.
    - Check client-side network bandwidth and proximity to the S3 region.
    - For many small files, consider zipping them first or parallelizing uploads.
- **High Costs:**
    - Audit storage classes using S3 Storage Lens or S3 Analytics.
    - Review Lifecycle Policies for effectiveness.
    - Check for incomplete multipart uploads (can be deleted via lifecycle rules).
    - Analyze data transfer costs (e.g., cross-region, to internet).
- **Object Not Found (404 Not Found):**
    - Verify object key (case-sensitive).
    - Check if versioning is enabled and if you're requesting a specific version ID.
    - Object may have been deleted or expired by a lifecycle rule.

## Best Practices

- **Enable Versioning** for all critical buckets to protect against accidental deletions and overwrites.
- **Use Lifecycle Policies** to automate storage tiering and object expiration for cost optimization and data
  governance.
- **Enforce Encryption:**
    - Use HTTPS for data in transit.
    - Enable default encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) on buckets.
    - Use SSE-KMS for enhanced control, auditing, and granular permissions.
- **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:** Use IAM roles, bucket policies, and Access Points to grant only necessary
  permissions.
- **Block Public Access** at the account and bucket level unless explicitly required.
- **Monitor Activity and Usage:**
    - Enable Server Access Logs and CloudTrail.
    - Use CloudWatch Metrics for S3 (e.g., bucket size, number of objects, request metrics).
    - Utilize **S3 Storage Lens** for organization-wide visibility and recommendations.
    - Use **S3 Analytics** to get insights into storage access patterns to make better decisions about storage class
      transitions.
- **Regularly review and audit** your S3 configurations and permissions using tools like AWS Config and IAM Access
  Analyzer.
- For static websites, **use CloudFront** in front of S3 for HTTPS, caching, and performance benefits.
- Understand **S3 consistency model**:
    - Read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects (you can read it immediately).
    - Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (changes might take a short time to propagate).
        - This is a key concept that often comes up.
